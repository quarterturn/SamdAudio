### Arduino Audio Library for Arduino SAMD21

NOTE:
This fork contains a very minor change aimed at eliminating digital noise coming from the DAC
even after the end() method is used. The DAC is enabled at each play() and disabled at each end() via DAC->CTRLA.bit.ENABLE


This polyphonic library allows you to play WAV files from SPI Flash and SD card to the 10bit DAC of a SAMD21 (Pin A0 on many boards). 
Plays up to ~4 WAV files simultaneously.

Adafruit has a nice tutorial on how to connect the pin to a 1/8" audio jack. The hookup [instructions are here](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-essentials/circuitpython-audio-out) (ignore the circiut python example as this library is for an Arduino sketch).

The 8bit sound quality is medium quality. I was able to get up to 44.1khz using SPI flash on the Adafruit M0 boards. The quality needed to  be reduced to ~22khz when playing from the SD card.

It all sounds fairly marginal at 8bit. Until there is a library with 16bit DMA output, I recommend going with a [Teensy](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Audio.html) or a peripherial codec to do the heavy lifting of playing quality audio.... but hey this all sounds better than the Arduino UNO.

The following Adafruit Express boards have onboard FLASH where you can store up to 2MB of sound ~30-60seconds.
This includes: 
* [Itsybits M0 Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3727) (tested)
* [Adafruit Metro M0 Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3505)
* [Trinket M0 Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3500) and Gemma Express no SPI Flash so SD card playing only. 
* Adafruit M4 Express boards with the SAMD51? should work

Thanks to Tony Dicola and Adafruit for making this so easy!

For the SD card example, these lines need to be edited in SamdAudio.cpp

To revert back to playing WAV files from flash storage example goes like this in SamdAudio.cpp:

            updated to work with Adafruit Qaud Flash memory boards.
            This will work with any SAMD21 chip using SPI flash with a little tinkering
